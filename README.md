# LuminAIR - Unlocking AI Integrity

Luminair is a **Machine Learning** framework that guarantees the integrity of graph-based models using **Zero-Knowledge proofs**. 
It enables a prover to cryptographically prove that the AI model's computations have been executed correctly. 
Consequently, a verifier can verify these proofs much faster and with fewer resources than by naively re-running the model.

Designed for parallel processing in trace and proof generation, Luminair also makes it easy to add support for new zk backends.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:** Luminair is currently under development and is not recommended for production environments.

## Backends

- **Cairo**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Only for PoC, not optimized for medium/large models.
- **Stwo**: WIP üèóÔ∏è

## Benchmarks
