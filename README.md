# LuminAIR - Unlocking AI Integrity

LuminAIR is a **Machine Learning** framework that guarantees the integrity of graph-based models with **Zero-Knowledge Circle Stark proofs**.

It enables a prover to cryptographically prove that the AI model's computations have been executed correctly. 
Consequently, a verifier can verify these proofs much faster and with fewer resources than by naively re-running the model.

Designed for parallel processing in trace and proof generation, LuminAIR also makes it easy to add support for new backends.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:** LuminAIR is currently under development üèóÔ∏è.
