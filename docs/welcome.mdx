<Warning> **Disclaimer**: LuminAIR is currently under active development üèóÔ∏è.</Warning>

**LuminAIR** enables provers to cryptographically demonstrate that a computational graph has been executed correctly, 
while verifiers can validate these proofs with significantly fewer resources than re-executing the graph.

This makes it ideal for applications where trustlessness and integrity are paramount, such as healthcare, finance, decentralized protocols and verifiable agents.
