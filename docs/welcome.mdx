<Warning> Disclaimer: LuminAIR is currently under development üèóÔ∏è.</Warning>

**LuminAIR** enables provers to cryptographically demonstrate that a computational graph has been executed correctly, 
while verifiers can validate these proofs with significantly fewer resources than re-executing the graph.

This makes it ideal for applications where trustlessness and integrity are paramount, such as healthcare, finance and decentralized protocols or agents.

For instance, a verifiable classifier could analyze market trends and dynamically adjust liquidity placement in an Automated Market Maker protocol. 
In this scenario, the model acts as a verifiable oracle, providing accurate insights without compromising the protocol‚Äôs trustlessness nature.
