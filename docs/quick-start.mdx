This guide walks you through the steps to:
1. **Build** a computational graph using tensor operations.
2. **Compile** and execute the graph to generate execution traces.
3. **Prove** the computational graph using C-STARK proofs.
4. **Verify** the proof to ensure computation integrity.


## Step 1: Create a Computational Graph

```rust
use luminair_graph::{graph::LuminairGraph, StwoCompiler};
use luminal::prelude::*;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

  // Create a new computational graph.
  let mut cx = Graph::new();

  // Define three 2x2 tensors with sample data.
  // In a real-world scenario, these could be input features, weights, etc.
  let a = cx.tensor((2, 2)).set(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]);
  let b = cx.tensor((2, 2)).set(vec![10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0]);
  let w = cx.tensor((2, 2)).set(vec![-1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0]);

  // Define computation operations on tensors:
  let c = a * b;       // Element-wise multiplication
  let d = c + w;       // Element-wise addition
  let mut e = (c * d).retrieve(); // Final operation
}
```

**At this stage**:
- No computation has been performed yet.
- The graph only defines the operations that will be executed later when the trace is generated.
  
## Step 2: Compile the Graph

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
  // Previous code ..

  // Compile the computation graph to transform the operations and prepare for execution.
  cx.compile(<(GenericCompiler, StwoCompiler)>::default(), &mut e);
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `GenericCompiler`: Applies backend-agnostic optimizations such as [CSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_subexpression_elimination).
- `StwoCompiler`: A specialized compiler provided by LuminAIR that replaces operations with their equivalent components in the AIR.

## Step 3: Execute the Graph & Generate Execution Trace

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
  // Previous code ..

  // Execute and generate a trace of the computation graph.
  // This is when the actual computation happens.
  let trace = cx.gen_trace();

  // Display the final result.
  println!("Final result: {:?}", e);
}
```
The actual computation happens during trace generation (`gen_trace()`).

## Step 4: Prove and Verify the Computation

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
  // Previous code ..

  // Generate a C-STARK proof for the execution trace.
  let proof = cx.prove(trace)?;

  // Verify the generated proof to ensure the integrity of the computation.
  cx.verify(proof)?;

  println!("Proof verified successfully. Computation integrity ensured. ðŸŽ‰");
}
```

<Tip>
In real-world scenarios, proving and verifying are typically performed by different entities:
- The prover generates the proof after executing the computation.
- The verifier validates that proof without needing to re-execute the computation
