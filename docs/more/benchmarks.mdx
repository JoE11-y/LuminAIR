## Understanding the Benchmarks

These benchmarks track the performance of key operations for each implemented [operator](/concepts/operators).

The benchmarks are run on every commit to the main branch, allowing us to track performance improvements or regressions over time.

## Benchmark Environment

All benchmarks are run in GitHub Actions using the following configuration:
- Ubuntu latest runner
- Rust nightly toolchain
- Criterion.rs benchmark framework

For more details on our benchmarking setup, see the [benchmark.yml](https://github.com/gizatechxyz/LuminAIR/blob/master/.github/workflows/benchmark.yml) workflow configuration.
