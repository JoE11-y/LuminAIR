# Welcome to the Luminair Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Luminair**! Whether you're aiming to enhance existing features or introduce new capabilities, your contributions are invaluable to our community. This guide provides detailed instructions on how you can contribute effectively to Luminair.

Luminair is built to support a wide array of **zkVMs (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines)**. Contributions can take various forms, including improving current zkVM compilers, developing new ones, or creating practical examples to showcase Luminair's capabilities.

## How You Can Contribute

### 1. Enhance Existing Compilers

Improve the functionality, performance, or compatibility of our existing zkVM compilers. For example, the `CairoCompiler` was the first compiler developed to run `Graphs` on CairoVM. There are ongoing issues and feature requests for existing compilers that you can help address.

### 2. Develop a New zkVM Compiler

If you want to support a zkVM that isn't currently integrated with Luminair, you can develop a new compiler. This involves creating a compiler tailored to the specific zkVM and ensuring it meets our quality standards.

### 3. Create Example Projects

Build example projects that demonstrate how to use Luminair with different zkVMs. These examples help users understand how to implement and leverage Luminair in their own projects.

## Developing a New zkVM Compiler

If you're interested in supporting a zkVM not yet integrated with Luminair, follow these steps to develop a new compiler.

### Requirements

#### Support for Primitive Operators

Each new zkVM compiler must support at least the following 11 primitive operators:

- **Unary Operators:** `Log2`, `Exp2`, `Sin`, `Sqrt`, `Recip`
- **Binary Operators:** `Add`, `Mul`, `Mod`, `LessThan`
- **Other Operators:** `SumReduce`, `MaxReduce`, `Contiguous`

#### Testing

Ensure all [tests](https://github.com/raphaelDkhn/LuminAir/blob/master/backends/cairo/src/tests/ops.rs) pass for primitive operations to verify compatibility and functionality.

## Understanding the `CairoCompiler` Implementation

To help you get started, let's explore how the `CairoCompiler` is implemented. This can serve as a reference for contributing to the `CairoCompiler` or adding a new zkVM compiler.

### Overview

The `CairoCompiler` is implemented in `cairo/src/lib.rs` as follows:

```rust
/// Compile graphs to run on CairoVM
pub type CairoCompiler = (prim::PrimitiveCompiler,);
```

This compiler is a tuple of sub-compilers optimized for CairoVM. 
Each zkVM compiler must include at least a `PrimitiveCompiler`. 
Additional sub-compilers can be added based on the specific requirements of the zkVM.

### Adding a Sub-Compiler

For instance, to implement a more efficient `Subtract` operation in Cairo, 
you can create a `SubtractCompiler` and integrate it into the `CairoCompiler`:

```rust
pub type CairoCompiler = (prim::PrimitiveCompiler, sub::SubtractCompiler);
```

This approach replaces the decomposed `Subtract` operation 
(using `Add` and `Mul` with `-1`) with a dedicated `Subtract` operator, enhancing efficiency.

### Implementing `PrimitiveCompiler`
The `PrimitiveCompiler` implements the `Compiler` trait from Luminal. Here's an excerpt of its implementation:

```rust
impl Compiler for PrimitiveCompiler {
    type Output = Result<(), CairoCompilerError>;

    fn compile<T: luminal::prelude::ToIdsMut>(
        &self,
        graph: &mut luminal::prelude::Graph,
        _: T,
    ) -> Self::Output {
        fn is<T: Any>(type_id: TypeId) -> bool {
            type_id == TypeId::of::<T>()
        }

        for id in graph.node_indices().collect::<Vec<_>>() {
            let op = graph.node_weight(id).unwrap().as_any().type_id();
            let op_ref = graph.graph.node_weight_mut(id).unwrap();

            if is::<Log2>(op) {
                let sierra_file = COMPILED_CAIRO_PATH.join("log2.sierra.json");

                *op_ref = Box::new(CairoLog2::new(
                    sierra_file,
                    self.runner_config.clone().into(),
                ));
            } else if is::<Add>(op) {
                let sierra_file = COMPILED_CAIRO_PATH.join("add.sierra.json");

                *op_ref = Box::new(CairoAdd::new(
                    sierra_file,
                    self.runner_config.clone().into(),
                ));
            }
            // ... Handle other primitive operators similarly
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

The `compile` function processes each node in the Luminal `Graph` and initializes its corresponding Cairo operation as follows:
```rust
pub struct $name {
    sierra_file: PathBuf,
    runner_config: Arc<CairoRunnerConfig>,
}
```

A Cairo operator contains the compiled zk-circuit of the specific operator along with runner configurations.

### Implementing Operators
Each operator must implement the `Operator` trait from Luminal. Here's an example for a unary operation:

```rust
impl Operator for CairoLog2 {
    fn process(&mut self, tensors: Vec<(InputTensor, ShapeTracker)>) -> Vec<Tensor> {
        if tensors.len() != 1 {
            panic!("Log2 operator requires exactly one input tensor.");
        }

        // Serialize inputs for the zkVM
        let inputs = serialize_unary_op(get_vec(&tensors[0].0));

        // Initialize the CairoVM runner
        let cairo_runner = CairoRunner::new((*self.runner_config).clone());
        match cairo_runner.run(self.sierra_file.clone(), inputs, false) {
            Ok(result) => vec![result],
            Err(e) => panic!("Error executing Cairo: {:?}", e),
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation handles the serialization of inputs and creates a CairoVM instance to execute the circuit.

### When Are `compile` and `process` Called?
Consider the following user-defined model:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut cx = Graph::new();
    let model = Linear::new(4, 5, false, &mut cx).initialize();
    let a = cx.tensor(4).set(vec![1., 2., 3., 4.]);
    let mut b = model.forward(a).retrieve();

    // Compile the graph with CairoCompiler
    let _ = cx.compile(CairoCompiler::default(), &mut b);

    // Execute the graph
    cx.execute();
}
```

- The `compile` function of `CairoCompiler` is invoked when the user calls `cx.compile()`.
- The `process` functions of the operators are invoked when the user executes the graph with `cx.execute()`.
