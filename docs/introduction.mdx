Luminair is a **Machine Learning** framework that guarantees the integrity of graph-based models using **Zero-Knowledge proofs**. 
It enables a prover to cryptographically prove that the AI model's computations have been executed correctly. 
Consequently, a verifier can verify these proofs much faster and with fewer resources than by naively re-running the model.

Designed for parallel processing in trace and proof generation, Luminair also makes it easy to add support for new zkVMs.
