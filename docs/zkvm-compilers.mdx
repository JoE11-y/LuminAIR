LuminAir offers a suite of compilers specialized for Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning.

## How It Works

A computational graph is broken down into individual operators, with each operator representing a node within the graph.
In LuminAir, every operator is a precompiled zk circuit. 
When you compile a graph for a specific zkVM supported by LuminAir, the `Compiler` matches each node's operator to its 
corresponding zk circuit.

Executing the graph (`cx.execute()`) runs each circuit in a separate instance of the chosen zkVM. 
This approach generates independent execution traces, which can then be proved in parallel by a prover.

## Supported zkVMs

LuminAir is actively developing support for a wide range of zkVMs. 
We encourage the community to contribute by adding support for new zkVMs. Feel free to open a PRs.

### LuminAir's Cairo Compiler

The `CairoCompiler` in LuminAir allows you to run a graph on CairoVM and generate proofs 
for the execution traces using a Cairo prover (like [Stone](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stone-prover/tree/main) or [Stwo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo)).

The simplest way to compile a graph using LuminAir's `CairoCompiler` is by using the default settings:

```rust
use luminair_cairo::CairoCompiler;

// ...

// Compile the graph using CairoCompiler
let _ = cx.compile(CairoCompiler::default(), &mut b);
```

However, if you need to customize the settings of your `CairoCompiler`, 
you can configure it accordingly to suit your specific requirements.
