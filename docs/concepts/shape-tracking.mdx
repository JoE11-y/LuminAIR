title: Shape Tracking
description: Compile-time shape tracking
---


When working with a [GraphTensor](/concepts/graph-tensor) in LuminAIR, you may notice that its type includes a specific generic parameter.
This parameter encodes the tensor’s shape directly at the type level, enabling compile-time shape tracking.


# What Does the Shape Parameter Represent?
Consider the following example:

```rust
let a: GraphTensor<R1<3>> = cx.tensor();
```

Here, `R1<3>` is the shape parameter of the `GraphTensor`. 
Let’s break it down:
- `R1`: Represents the rank of the tensor, which is the number of dimensions it has.
In this case, `R1` denotes a rank-1 tensor (a one-dimensional tensor).
- `<3>`: Specifies the size of the tensor along its single dimension.
Here, `<3>` means the tensor contains 3 elements

Together, `R1<3>` defines a one-dimensional tensor with 3 elements—a 3-dimensional vector.

# How Does Shape Tracking Work?
The shape parameter (`R1<N>`) is implemented as a type alias for `(Const<N>,)`, 
where `Const<N>` is a compile-time constant representing the size of the tensor.

This design allows Rust to enforce tensor shapes at compile time, ensuring that:

1. **Shape Mismatches Are Caught Early**: Tensor operations are only allowed between tensors with compatible shapes.
2. **No Runtime Shape Calculations**: Since shapes are encoded in types, there’s no need to compute or validate shapes during execution.
